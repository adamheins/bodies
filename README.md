# Bodies
A simple simulation of bodies with gravitational attraction and elastic
collisions.

In this simulation, the gravitational constant, G, is not the same as it is in
the real world. This is to make both its value and the required mass values for
the bodies easier to work with.

If you want to play with this yourself, clone the repository and open the
`index.html` file in a browser. To change the properties of the bodies, edit
the code in the `getBodies` function.

A demo can be found [here](https://adamheins.com/projects/bodies/).
